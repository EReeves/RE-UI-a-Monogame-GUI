    ///     Those automatically honor keyboard-layout and repeat-frequency of the keyboard for all platforms.
    ///     The flag filterSpecialCharactersFromCharPressed you may specify when calling Initialize tells the class to filter
    ///     those characters exposed in the SpecialCharacters char[] or not.
    ///     When running on a OpenGl-system those characters are not captured by the system. So the default for filtering them
    ///     out is for the sake of compatibility.
    ///     The repetition of the special characters as well as the arrow keys, etc, is handled by the class itself using the
    ///     values you pass it when calling Initialize.
    ///     The repetition is not done by sending the characters through the CharPressed event (since they may be not even
    ///     characters and some of them are omitted by the OpenGl platform), but through the KeyPressed event and the keys are
    ///     captured by getting the KeyboardState from MonoGame in the Update-method.
    ///     So if you want to capture those, use that one.
